- improved retina support (no more bluriness) <- haven't done search bar icons/dataset info/selected icon yet
- improved button triggering <- haven't done topic select back button yet
- improved button clarity
- bigger search bar 
- slider snaps to side (alex's idea)
- marker on searched location (default leaflet marker for now)
- pan to center of searched location on marker click
- responsiveness improvements
- data separated into three groups
- dataset descriptions
- user testing prompts
- datasets and slider position saved
- pin dataset
- pinned dataset defaults on top

To do:

- better location zooming
