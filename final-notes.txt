# TO DO

- finish dataset labels
- change mobile header to white on menu select [Alex, Sam]
- allow toggle of other pin since slider snaps

# BUGS

- postcode bug
- hide search frame on geolocation whilst in search
- collapse expanded description on map select exit
- loading gif not working
- pin prompt + pin showing when slider is fully to right
- on init left button/slider appearing momentarily

# DONE

- search bar better toggling
- hide pin until dataset selected
- make loading icon lighter
- finish loading indicator
- scale indicator + restyling
- fully responsive initial prompts
- info button responsiveness
- better structuring for prompts (only checked off if action actually performed)
- source fixed
- fix pinning
- loading searches appearing too slow, should be on first type (currently on ajax beforesend)
- faster button feedback
- current location still showing as 'favourited' after deletion
- saved location not being removed from local storage

# TIPS
- Mike: no need to empty before filling e.g. with text/html
- Mike: display loading immediately on search, before send
- Anda: use left/right/top/bottom where appropriate rather than margin (prompts)
