# TO DO

- finish dataset labels
- finish loading indicator
- change mobile header to white on menu select [Alex, Sam]

# BUGS

- make loading icon lighter
- hide pin until dataset selected
- current location still showing as 'favourited' after deletion
- saved location not being removed from local storage
- on init left button/slider appearing momentarily
- info button responsiveness

# DONE

- scale indicator + restyling
- fully responsive initial prompts
- better structuring for prompts (only checked off if action actually performed)
- source fixed
- fix pinning
- loading searches appearing too slow, should be on first type (currently on ajax beforesend)
- faster button feedback

# TIPS
- Mike: no need to empty before filling e.g. with text/html
- Mike: display loading immediately on search, before send
- Anda: use left/right/top/bottom where appropriate rather than margin (prompts)
